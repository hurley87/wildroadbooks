export const CORE_DEFINITIONS = `Core Definitions for "Catching Unicorns":

Exographics: The technology of inscribing persistent meanings/symbols on a visual medium (e.g., writing, mathematics, diagrams, musical notation). It allows humans to offload memory and manipulate abstract concepts.

e-Class: A specific subset of ideas (cultural objects) that cannot be discovered without exographics (e.g., calculus, the novel, the skyscraper). This contrasts with ideas discoverable by the naked mind/hands (e.g., the spear, the wheel).

The Ideasphere: The total collection of all cultural objects and ideas innovated by humans throughout history.

The Diaconatic: An embodied model of ideation (discovery) consisting of a loop of two steps:

Logos (Thinking): Assessing the current state and planning the next move.

Praxis (Action): Physically engaging with the world (e.g., writing a formula, sketching, mixing chemicals) to test the thought.

Techno-Literate Culture: Modern culture defined by four traits: widespread literacy, a distinct class of "e-Class" discoverers, complex socio-economic structures (cities, markets), and an education system designed to teach literacy and exographics.

Reification: The process of using exographics to turn an abstract concept (like the number "23") into a visible object in the real world, making it manipulable.`;
